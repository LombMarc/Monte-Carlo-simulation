# Monte-Carlo-simulation
A collection of code that will help in the creation of any kind of monte carlo simulation 
In the first file is defined the code to acquire stocks data from libreries as pandas datareder.
Then is defined a stochastic process, in particular a generalized Wiener process, ued to plot a possible path of stock prices.
Then this process is repeated multiple time to define the monte carlo simulation
